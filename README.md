### Tech

- ##### Lifetime Activity Dashboard
  - Used google chart api for implementing same (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs)
  
- ##### API Optimization
   - Old code
        ```sh
          return $totalReviewAndRating = User::with(['ratings'=>function($q) use($id){
            $q->where('google_place_id', '=', $id)
              ->groupBy('user_id');
                },'reviews' =>function($q) use($id){
                    $q->where('google_place_id', '=', $id)
                    ->groupBy('user_id');
                }])
                ->orwhereHas('ratings',function($q) use($id){
                    $q->where('google_place_id', '=', $id);
                })
                ->orwhereHas('reviews',function($q) use($id){
                    $q->where('google_place_id', '=', $id);
                })->count();
        ```
    - New code 
         ```sh
              $rating = \DB::table("ratings")
                ->select("ratings.user_id")
                ->where('google_place_id', $id);

        return  $review = \DB::table("reviews")
                ->select("reviews.user_id")
                ->where('google_place_id', $id)
                ->union($rating)
                ->groupBy('user_id')
                ->count(); 
            ```
    
   In old code we used unnecessary join and also used laravel conditional Eloquent join on multiple tables which is usually slow.because it's create multiple sub query inside query for each record. It's one kind of laravel drawback.
